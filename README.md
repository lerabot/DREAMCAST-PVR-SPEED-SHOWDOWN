# DREAMCAST-PVR-SPEED-SHOWDOWN 2020
### You think your rendering pipeline is the fastest? Time to prove it, cowboy!

After many discussion and reading claims from various sources, we ([the Simulant Discord channel](https://simulant-engine.appspot.com)) decided to start 2020 with something that will make your PVR scream; a race for the highest polycount. This being said, not all poly are equal; some are lighted, textured and some are even z-clipped! *We want it all.*

The goal behind this contest is to showcase people tricks and tips in order to speed all of our beautiful Dreramcast indie/homebrew projects. The only rule is that the source must be made public, and ideally on a Git-based platform.
